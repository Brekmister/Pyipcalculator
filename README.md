# PyIP Calculator
A basic IP Subnet Calculator written in Python using the Guietta library that can give useful information about a IPv4 or IPv6 subnet and address.

## Setup and run
1. Clone the repository to your machine (Or download the ZIP and extract it to a folder)
2. Install the latest version of Python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. Open up CMD/Powershell/Terminal and navigate over to the folder where this repo sits.
4. Run the command: `pip install guietta` or `pip3 install guietta`
5. Run the command: `python pyipcalculator.py`

## Operating
Once the fields is filled out with a valid IP and subnet, the information will be calculated out automatically. Change a number and the results will change on it's own. If the input doesn't resolve to a valid IP Address and/or subnet then the resulting output will not change.
